"Boyfriend and I ordered togo sushi and picked up a couple bottles of sake next door to have dinner at home. Our friends told us they weren't fans of Sushi Maru, but we decided to give it a shot anyway. We had:-HAMACHI ROLL (I love yellowtail and thought this was great! They added green onion, which complimented it well. Bf isn't too keen on yellowtail, so I ate it all) -SAKE ROLL (You can't go wrong with salmon. The pieces are a decent size) -TEKKA ROLL (I'm not too big on tuna, so bf had this. He liked it) -RAINBOW ROLL (We were both impressed! The crab meat had great flavor. Super delicious and we will order again) We got all of that and only spent about $20! Dinner was perfect and we both liked it very much. Next time we'll dine in and take advantage of their conveyor belt sushi bar."
"I am pleased to recommend this restaurant in San Jose's ""Japantown""right next door to Union Bank. The restaurant is quite popular and fills up at lunchtime.  The service is fast and friendly.   There is a sushi-boat bar for those who are so inclined as it is definitely well-liked.  The booths are spacious and comfortable.  The  luncheon menu  is somewhat limited. Their tempura appetizer is really remarkable, both in taste and price, ample and affordable.  I was slightly disappointed in their salad dressing.  It's usually so good in Japanese restaurants. The restaurant is clean as is the ladies' room. Parking is not a problem. There is both street (metered) and lot parking."
great food been going to japan town since i was a young tadpole. love all the different restaurants and stores in area will be going to this restaurant again
"Small sushi boat restaurant located in SJ Japantown. Sushi Maru looks a bit outdated but their food is pretty decent. I ordered a bowl of agedashi tofu and my mom ordered their chicken terriyaki lunch. The agedashi tofu was decent, definitely could be slightly crispier but the flavors were alright. We also grabbed a few plates off the sushi belt and they were decent but they were a tad pricey for okay quality.  Overall this place is alright. It's not high on my list to revisit but if i'm in the area, i'll probably try it out again."
"Sushi Maru is one of the many gems of SJ's Japan town. They have a rotating sushi belt, but also a solid menu of entrees as well as individual nigiri and hand roll options. My friend and I both ordered the Chef's sushi special and some hot sake- the toro and salmon belly with skin were to DIE for. It was a great way to get a taste of everything. I definitely want to come back and try some of the other entrees or for some more yummy nigiri, but ultimately...this is a very, very sushi place but not the best I've tried. I'd give 3.75 stars if I could  However, I'd still come back if I'm looking for a good spot in Japan town."
"'ve enjoyed lunch here numerous times and have loved each visit. They have a daily special which is always out of the ordinary bento box, but we come here for the sushi. It's always so fresh and beautifully prepared. There is a sushi conveyor belt that circulates the freshly made eats for the perusal of those sitting at the bar. We typically order ama ebi (sweet shrimp) and torched salmon nigiri. Each dish comes with 2 pieces and is not cheap ($5-6/pair), but it's so worth it! The shrimp is always tender and sweet. They fry the heads so you can enjoy their crunchy, briney glory. The torched salmon is phenomenal! You must try it! It's called nanoku. Each sushi dish from the bar is color coded and corresponds to a price. The dishes are on the wall so you can tally up as you eat (if you so choose). We love it here & cant wait to return! Oiishi!!"
"Sushi Maru is a conveyor belt sushi restaurant and a popular lunch spot during the week. Unlike the Sushi Maru in Milpitas, this location has GOOD food. I've never really tried the sushi here and usually end up ordering from their lunch menu/specials. For about $10.99-12.99, you can get an entree (or two depending on if you opt for the combo) plus salad and soup. The options are decent and the food is filling. If you come here often, you probably already know about their stamp card. I think you need to spend $200 in six months in order to save $15 on your next bill.  This place opens at 11:30am during the week so come early because this place fills up quickly!"
"There were a few gems hidden here (seared salmon, some of the items on the wall such as the mackeral), but most of the sushi I got here was rather average. Tried the Tempura Soba as well, which had the same problem of being unremarkable."
"Pretty inconsistent, but I can't resist that seared salmon! My friend Lily is the BEST at ordering, and I'm so spoiled that when I come on my own, I sometimes forget what to order.  I always go for the seared salmon (towards the bottom on the paper menu) and white tuna tataki appetizer. The last two times I've gone, we've ordered the 5 piece appetizer and only gotten 3 pieces! We cleared it up today, but I wonder if we were previously overcharged? For today's visit alone, the first piece I had was really firm/cooked on the bottom, whereas the 2nd round of tataki that came out was really soft and tender. Our order of 8 pieces of seared salmon also came out COLD, pretty disappointing! Despite the minor ups and downs, I'm sure I'll be back--especially with those occasional discount cards they hand out!"
"Food: Sushi, bento, udon, donburi.....all consistent and good flavors. If you are seated at the sushi bar, you can order as needed as well as take from the conveyor belt. The rolls are good size and there is board of what fresh fish are available. The wasabi and ginger are in community containers, so you just be cautious, and you could ask for a fresh batch from behind the counter if you need to. Overall the dishes are consistent with what Japanese cuisine is and you will always have decent meal. Service: Sit at the booth closest to the sushi bar if you don't want to wait for you rolls as you can grab from the belt and order from the menu. Seats at the bar allow to order from the menu but the space is limited for bigger plates. When it gets busy you may wait a little longer for your orders. Ambiance: Clean, simple and good for smaller groups and easy to have conversations."
"I struggle with this joint.  To me it's a ""tweener"" meaning it's sometimes ""just-ok"" while others it's ""Not-ok.""  Let's go with a true 2.5 Stars here. I've had good service and some not-so-good service here which is annoying.   The food isn't bad but the quality of the sushi is borderline and it's debatable on how long they've been riding the ""sushi-go-round.""  Oh, and the price for sushi is in the realm of ""that wasn't worth it"" and ""stick to non-sushi dishes."""
"Delicious food and great service, but a little expensive...  I'm a big fan of their pumpkin croquette and the nanook (seared salmon nigiri). Their dinner boxes and other sushi are pretty good too. Total cost for dinner for two: around $75. Not sure if this quite makes up for the price, but they do have a frequent diner's stamp card. However, there is a time frame that you have to earn the stamps within.  Sitting at the conveyor belt sushi bar was cho natsukashii (nostalgic)."
"I've come here once before and the first time was good. This time... no. The food on the rotating bar was NOT fresh. The bento box was ok but as I was sitting there eating, the sushi chef started picking his nose and then picked up his phone and checked his POF account. Yeah, never coming here again."
"Came here because someone recommended it. I heard it was the best ""sushi boat"" restaurant. But I was sorely disappointed. First, the sushis on the conveyor belt weren't really sushis; they were rolls (with excessive amounts of rice). Less than 5% of the items on the belt were what I would call sushi or quality Japanese appetizers.  A bit turned off by the fishiness (teehee) on the conveyor belt, my buddy and I mozzied over to a regular table and each ordered a bento box, which was decent at best.   Look, if you are doing Japanese food, then go all top-notch quality OR go simple w/no frills. Don't feign top-notch, but offer the other. Next time, I will try another Japanese restaurant in town."
"Came here with the boyfriend on a Saturday night at 8:30pm. There is a sign posted at the front that you can only sit in a booth if you have a party of 3 or more, so we sat at the sushi bar with the revolving belt. Upon sitting, there is a box of ginger (winning for me) for you to eat as you please and they will also provide you a tub of wasabi (win for the boyfriend). You can either order off the menu or pick off the belt. There are 4 types of plates with different pricing from $5-$7. Don't see anything you like on the belt? No problem, just ask the sushi chefs to make it for your and there you have it! There are a variety of half rolls, nigiri and desserts on the belt. Boyfriend and I ate a total of 9 plates together, a pitcher of beer, side salad and a miso soup, the bill came out to about $75. (pretty pricey in my opinion, considering their portions) There is also a stamp card if dining here based on how many plates you pick off the sushi bar.  3 stars because I am not convinced that the fish was all that fresh since I woke up a few time to run to the bathroom in the middle of the night :( However, the service is great, the sushi chefs and the servers are very friendly. You will also have to find metered street parking if dining here. Tip: Last call for the kitchen is 30 minutes before closing, if you are on a budget and adventurous, definitely come during this time. They will combine two plates into one on the belt of whatever is left and you will totally get bang for your buck ;)"
"This place is amazing! The staff was so friendly and we were seated quickly (it was also 30 min from closing, so this could be different for earlier in the day). My partner and I decided to try a little bit of everything, so he got a plate that came with two entrées, salad, rice, and 3 CA rolls. I got a bowl of chicken udon noodles. We both shared the Nanook rolls and Jackson rolls. They were all so delicious! This place also has that cool conveyor belt for their sushi and you have the option of just eating those. Pricing for sushi is based on the kind of plate you get, lowest being $3.99 and highest being $6.49. Very good food, will be visiting again."
"This is my favorite sushi place in San Jose! Super good, super high quality too. Great people that work there. My family and I have been going to this restaurant for so long and it gets better and better! Really recommend going."
"Stopped by for a quick lunch on the way back from Santa Cruz. Although it was memorials day, I was surprised that the restaurant was only half full. We had a big group of 15, but were seated pretty quickly. It's a standard Japanese restaurant with bento boxes, sushi, and bowls.  They also have daily specials, which change everyday. I got the sushi lunch ($15.99) which comes with nigiri, baked fish, california role, oranges, and some small side dishes. It also comes with a salad and miso soup, which came out first. The sushi was pretty standard, I like how they didn't put a lot of rice with the sushi. The baked fish was pretty fatty, but it wasn't too salty or under seasoned. The seaweed salad on the side was he perfect pallete cleanser.  I also liked how the dish came with slices of Orange, which was refreshing after the meal. You get what you pay for and it was the perfect amount for me. Overall, a good Japanese restaurant with friendly staff and clean atmosphere.   Highly recommend stopping by if you are in San Jose Japan town."
"more like 2.5 stars but I'll never go back again, maybe the sushi/roll are better but the lunch set was terrible. miso soup was way salty, 0 dressing on the salad (maybe that's why), the teriyaki sauce they put on the beef don was like concentrated oyster sauce, it's so salty that it's just not edible, ended up leaving the bowl as is, couldn't eat it"
"Great location, nice atmosphere. Sit at the bar and pick from the sushi round about. Great assortment including desserts. Fast service and Parking is easy. Can select from the items presented or order directly."
"The plusses: Food is very good, service is friendly, reasonable price, and we didn't have to wait long.  Also, the sushi at the bar is all covered with plastic covers to keep it sanitary -- most restaurants just let it sit out exposed to the elements. The minuses: crowded, feels a bit cramped (they don't seem to make the best use of space the way other restaurants do in Japantown), and we had to sit at the sushi bar because they're aren't enough tables. Overall this was a very good restaurant, but if I ever go back I'll choose a time when it isn't rush hour."
"Very welcoming, very accommodating staff when you first walk in. They will do their best to seat you together no matter the size of your group. It's not a large restaurant. Half of it is a U-shaped sushi bar with ""boats"" circling around with a variety of sushi, desserts, and even drinks. The other half are small tables and six or so booths that hold up to four diners. The food is always fresh and there is a varied menu from which to choose. There always seems to be a wait for tea and water refills though -- many times we have to ask."
"You need to chose the guy in the bar to make Nanook but not the women. She made it in heavy soil sauce flavor which cover all the salmon taste.  The bad thing is after I talked to the waiter, she asked me rudely 'so what do you want me to do?' Update 5/25/17 after a year visit again. Taste still good. Eggplant and kalbi recommend. Just don't argue the food with them you will be fine."
"So yummy here, we where here on Christmas Eve. And we wanted sushi, thank good it was open that day. Service was great, food was excellent and the employees where up to beat. I can't wait to eat here again. The bento  box was enough food for us to share.. we also got some sushi and oysters at the bar to keep us full. Hot tea is always a bonus.."
"This is my favorite sushi place. The staff and chefs are friendly and always working hard. The location is located conveniently in downtown. Just a couple blocks away from Coleman and Taylor. This is my go to place. Whenever I have a craving for sushi, I always end up choosing their teriyaki salmon over the sushi on the conveyor belt. It's not that the I don't like their sushi, it's just that their salmon is REALLY good. It's never dry and it's never too saucy. Also, they have THE best baked mussels out there. Its always made fresh to order, so it always comes out hot. Its very flavorful: Its sweet, chewy, and a little bit spicy. Other places can't compare.  Some drawback is that it is quite small inside. It can get pretty crowded and you while you're seated, you may have to wait a little while until more sushi plates are placed on the belt. They also don't have those special sushi rolls like the ""Dragon roll"" or ""Spider-Man roll."" But it's okay, you're in Japantown. This ain't no Asian fusion place. With all that, I don't mind the wait. It's amazing to watch and see how the chefs move so quickly. I always end up having a good time and I leave with my belly full! Can't complain about that"
"Probably my fav sushi place in South Bay.  The key things to have here are the tai (do not dip they pre season), seated salmon ( also same) and their homemade soba."
Came here for lunch on a Friday and the line was out the door. It moved quickly though. We both had the salmon teriyaki bento box and it was DELICIOUS! We also had some rolls from the sushi boats that were equally as delicious! Loved it and will most definitely be back.
"Food is delicious, portion is just right, and price is reasonable. I had lunch here every time I visit Downtown San Jose during the weekend and stopped by at Nikita maker next block for grocery shopping after lunch."
A quick and convenient place for dinner. Especially if you eat in a booth by the sushi conveyor belt.
"Best bento place ever! We eat here like every month. We get the Chicken Teriyaki and Katsu Combo & Lion King Roll. The best, they never disappoint. Plus, very affordable and great customer service. I'm speechless. They're that good!"
Sushi Maru San Jose is truly a Hidden Gem the place is always clean and neat all of the staff make you feel welcome and the food is truly consistent every time we haven't eaten there. The dinners are about $15 each with drinks and hors d'oeuvres about $22 per person for dinner and you truly walk away full and very satisfied.
"I came here for lunch today with my friend and his Mom, and was surprised when I saw that it was a sushi boat place. I had never come to a sushi boat place before because my Dad is a sushi snob. I was surprised by how much space the conveyer belt took up.  The sushi conveyer belt was an efficient way to add things to your order, but over time, as more people took sushi from the conveyer belt, there weren't many things to grab.  Therefore we needed to ask the sushi chef to make the sushi for us, which defeated the purpose of the conveyer belt. My friend recommended getting the nanook, which was seared salmon with a sweet sauce. When I first bit into the salmon, a bunch of fat poured out from the searing. The searing also made the salmon much softer, and brought out a lot of the natural salmon flavor. Most of the fish was decent quality, except for the tuna, which didn't have much flavor and was a little hard. Overall, this is a pretty good meal, and if you take advantage of the conveyer belt, you can really fill yourself up here."
"I go because it's close to my home. I know what to order right in Japanese. Price is a lot higher than sushi in Japan. But among all other sushi restaurants in San Jose Japantown area, this is the best one."
I had the Chicken teriyaki and Salmon along with the Eel and Octopus Sushi and it was very good. The service here was very fast and friendly. Prices for what you get are reasonable. I would definitely come back again.
The sushi is here is just as I would expect from a sushi bar. The fish is fresh and can be made to order. They do have a rotating belt as well. There is a meal menu for those that like Japanese food but not sushi. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. It was a stop I make when visiting San Jose even though I live in Japan and regularly eat sushi.
"Our families favorite sushi spot here in Japantown. Love the options and the chefs really make sure you are full and happy. Sushi boat has good options and more you can choose from on the far wall. More of a traditional style sushi, not many fancy specialty rolls. Bento Boxes seem to be filling as well. Overall, have great experience here and we continue to go back when we are walking down Japantown for sushi."
this review is not about their food. not about their service. im giving this place a 1 star this time around simply because we were denied a sushi bar booth. their rule i guess is in order to sit in a booth you have to have 4 people in your party. we had three. not only that. the host sat a party of three people in a booth and we got there first!!!! are you kidding me??? we settled for a table. in front of us are 2 parties of 3. sitting in the sushi bar booth. wow.
"Where do I start? So my mom and I came on a busy day, Valentine's Day for dinner. So to wait for a bar seat we had to wait a bit but tables were open here and there. My mom insisted we wait for a bar seat haha. It took a while but that's okay. It took a while for the waiter to come take our drink orders which is quite understandable since it was such a busy night. The options they had going around the sushi bar weren't crazy but nonetheless was it  fresh!!!!!! Holy hell the fish was delicious. The chefs and waitress were nice even though they were busy and not as attentive. They took forever to give us our bill and wouldn't grab it even though they clearly saw us ready to pay. I had to walk up front to make them swipe the card lol. We came here because my mother's former boss used to rave about this being the freshest sushi in town and the guy is Japanese from Japan! So we had to come here and boy was he right!!! Will definitely be coming back again on a slower night."
"Ordered the beef tongue and chef's special sushi. The presentation was fine but man was this an off day for them. I took one bite of the uni and I was disgusted. It was not only foul tasting, it was clear that the uni was not fresh at all. I immediately spat out most of it and just lost my appetite. I couldn't even stomach more than a bite of the beef tongue before I paid the bill and left. It is about half an hour from when I had the ""meal"" and I feel super queasy.  This was my first experience at sushi maru and I won't be back. They clearly are not keeping their less popular items fresh. Worst 40 dollars spent. Please, for your own safety do not order the uni (sea urchin)."
"Best sushi at a reasonable price. The nangook and uni, and California roll topped w uni are some of my favorites!"
my husband and I come here at least once a week! food their food and reasonable price. I always order their lunch combo it's a great deal! sometimes it's hard to find parking here though.
"1. The people. So nice, attentive and quick. If you sit at the bar you can see how talented the chefs are and how fast! The waitresses aren't really waitresses, they just all help each other out and are really nice.  2. Also it's pretty small and I wish it was more roomy, it's cozy and you're at least not completely elbow to elbow with the person next to you.  3. The food. YUMMMMMMM! The spicy calamari is the best calamari I've had in a LONGGGGG while. Ask for it and they'll make it nice and warm. We get a sushi with salmon and lemon on top of a California roll with some Siracha on top and it's Delish.  All in all, I love this place. Not my first time here and won't be the last. They greet us so friendly when we come in and I love it."
"The menu is slightly limited, not many rolls (no special rolls, rolls come in 2-6 pieces at 2.99-5.99 per order).  Lunch bento box is $11. The quality of food is good (the raw fish tasted fresh) and everything just tastes light, as it should.  Miso soup is top notch.  Rolls are tasty. They have a conveyer belt, and if you have a group of 3 or more you can sit at an actual table next to the belt."
"I seriously think about this place A LOT! My go to things to order here: halibut fin, red snapper, and nanook....amazing.  The service can be slow at times, but they're busy, but if you're okay with my loud little nephew, you're amazing to me.  Plus the food, I can't get enough of...remember to get their stamp card. You now know where to spot me!!"
"Food was pretty good with decent price. The place has both sushi belt and tables so you can order with the server or may pick up & order to the sushiman. The server doesn't come often to take your order so if you're not ordering hot food, better off order to the sushi bar directly if you're eating at the booth or the bar."
"It was my first time coming here for lunch with my dad! We came around 1pm and decided to sit by the bar.  For their food, I just stuck with nigiri. I ordered ebi and a tempura nigiri. Their ebi tasted really fresh. One of the freshest sushi I've tasted I feel. Their sushi rice is also good with its light sweetness and perfect texture. The tempura nigiri was also delicious because they dipped the rice in some kind of sauce, but it tasted delicious and it went well with the tempura. My dad ordered the fried oysters for appetizers and he enjoyed them as well.  Since we came close to closing time, they would put two different kinds of sushi on one plate so you get more on one plate! So awesome. It'd be a shame wasting all that sushi anyways. I would definitely come back for lunch!"
"My kids love this place. They can each eat their own bowl of udon, couple plates of sushi and edamame. And they'll sit through the meal without asking for my phone so I can actually enjoy my kastsu donburi."
"A great sushi boat type restaurant with delicious, fresh fish! My boyfriend and I sat at the conveyor belt and had two different rolls from it; I also got the katsu don, and he got the chef's special sushi. My katsu don was delicious! It was sweet and savory and the onions were delicious. My boyfriend said he loved the fish selectiob, and that the uni (sea cucumber) was absolutely amazing, like butter! We're definitely coming back to try more of the sushi boat rolls in the near future!"
"Sat at the bar and the service was terrible.  Fish was presliced and the portion of fish for nigiri was very thin.  Variety was Not very good, most of the standard rolls included crab salad, which i dont like.  Not a very good value.  Will not go back."
"Fresh sushi and sashimi. Check out the daily lunch special, sometimes it's pretty unique (not regular items on the menu). Atmosphere is friendly, there could be a short line during lunch hours. Finding a parking space nearby occasionally can be a challenge."
"I've been here at least 15 times over the last 10 years and it's still consistent! This place is always poppin which keeps everything on the conveyer belt fresh ;) I love their salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, tempura, katsu donburi, nanook (flame torched salmon belly nigiri), unagi nigiri, and chirashi :-))) Fresh fish, average prices. Yum !"
First time here and the people were very nice and the food was good. Enjoyed the beef tariyaki and some of the sushi's my friend was having me tryout.
Great place! Cheap fresh quality food and prompt friendly service. Waited a little to be seated but every single restaurant em Japatown has a waiting list.  Baked mussle shooter are delicious here!
"My go to sushi bar in San Jose.  I have come here for many years and when I read yelp reviews for sushi restaurants I quickly appreciate that people don't know what good sushi tastes like.  High quality, authentic Japanese sushi, and the prices haven't gone up in years plus they give you a stamp card to come back."
Fresh and yummy.
"My sister in law and brother in law took me here for the first tine.  I must say, I LOVE it!  My favorite ones are the nanook and tai....so ooooo good!  Will definitely come back!"
"This location is definitely on the decline. We stopped by yesterday for lunch. My husband and I ordered the bento box, and we both picked salmon and tuna sashimi. The fish tasted old, but the worst part was we got food poisoning from it. Will never visit again."
"Get nigiri here; for the quality you get, the price is unbelievable! Make sure to get a stamp card for some savings here and there :) Unagi, nanook, and saba are some of my favorites. Their unagi nigiri is the best I've had, and only thing in the world I have to eat with my eyes closed every single time.  My sister really enjoys their Toro, too. Their ginger is nice if you like to clean your palate without harassing your sinuses! Green tea is delicious, and comes piping hot. It's a minus star because even though staff are very friendly, they seem to get overwhelmed if there's a party of more than 6 in the restaurant. The last time we went, there was a birthday party of maybe 8, and we kept having to remind our server of some requests.  The entree items also came out way slower than usual even though the restaurant wasn't filed. "
"I was on a shopping trip to SJ and fell into Sushi Maru. We were headed to Gombei Japanese Restaurant, when we arrived at Gombei we found out that they only took cash. We walked to the bank to get cash and  the atm was broken. Next to the bank with the broken atm was Sushi Maru. Bam! Divine intervention. We had a wonderful dinner. The service was very fast and friendly. We both had the dinner combo, the bento box, and we both enjoyed it. Dinner for two was under $40. A happy accident that I would be happy to repeat."
"Not much of a wait during 12:30 lunch time. It is somewhat busy. There's a sushi boat conveyor belt at the bar or you can sit at a regular table. Service was fast too. Sashimi was very fresh, good quality, and delicious! Not to mention, its not too expensive.   I love white fish so I ordered mostly white fish sashimi. Hamachi, Albacore, Toro, Halibut, Saba and two other ones I forgot the name. Love the california rolls too! Real crabmeat and huge. The sushi rice was good too."
"Showed up and there was no table my kid could get a high chair for without obstructing the walk ways. The hostess, who also busses tables and serves, kindly asked if a table of 3 dudes drinking wouldn't mind moving to another table. They agreed and we were seated. Super accommodating. The food was pretty dang good. I walked out feeling %100 satisfied and thankful I live walking distance. Only thing I have to say is TURN YOUR HEATER OFF!!! It was so freakin hot in there. 5 star none the less."
This cute little place opened in the early 2000 and its delightful that it has remained among many other J-town legends. The conveyor belt sushi is fun and seems very fresh. The cooked dishes are delicious as well. It can take a while to be seated and to get your bill at the end.
"We have been to many Sushi restaurants and this one truly is among  the best. There pricing is lower than most and the qualiy at the top. Friendly, clean, fast, and tasty!"
Went there for lunch today. Sat at the conveyor because I like to eat quickly. Was decent but plates are much more than the place in McCarthy ranch
"It is a nice authentic place. My first time eating at conveyor belt sushi bar in the U.S.  In Japan, it is called Kaiten-zushi and very popular but I had not known that it existed in the U.S.   My friend and I ate 35 plates, which means 70 pieces of sushi.  I am crazy for salmon.  I ate two kinds of salmon here (raw and with tare). Both great. The Japanese chef in the bar was really nice and professional. It is better to arrive by 7 p.m., otherwise a long line can be formed."
"Walking around sj japantown in the carmeet and me and my sibs decide to eat some Japanese food. This place is pretty busy but we got seated right away. However, we waited about 20 mins to have our order taken. The food was decent. It wasnt the best japanese food but it was okay. I love how the waiters speak japanese though. Overall experience was good and the food was decent."
I used to absolutely love this place and had recommended it to many many friends however the service has gone steadily downhill they hired a bunch of new servers that have don't have a clue what they're doing. It makes me sad because this was my go-to Japanese place. But with the service quality and you can tell her there's no one in the restaurant on Friday and Saturday night anymore it's not the same owner has gotten cheap on service. It breaks my heart as I will no longer be coming here
got the beef teriyaki lunch. not bad. the sushi boat needs some work
"Great friendly service. The tori kawa ponzu is my guilty pleasure (fried chicken skin in ponzu sauce). Sushi is great, friendly chefs, great waitresses. No matter how busy they are always welcoming. This is my new normal spot now that I have moved to San Jose. I hope it always stays like this."
"Sushi Maru in Jtown is top notch value. I would say arguably the best value sushi in San Jose. Now, don't get me wrong when I say value, the fish here is actually quite fresh and good. Their daily lunch specials are always a really good deal, usually coming with some kind of dashi based soup, a mini chirashi bowl or tuna-don, and some other meat entree. Their sushi and sashimi specials are also really quite good for how cheap they are (and beautiful presentation too!). They don't take reservations here, but if you're a regular, you can get a discount card where they give you a $15 gift card every few visits. It's a really solid place to have as your ""go-to"" sushi place in SJ."
